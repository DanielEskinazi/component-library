# Installation

Get started with @mycomponents by installing the packages you need for your project.

## Package Structure

Our component library is organized as a monorepo with separate packages for different platforms and styling options:

- **Core packages**: Platform-agnostic business logic
- **Web packages**: React, Vue, Svelte, and Vanilla JS implementations
- **Mobile packages**: React Native implementations
- **Utility packages**: Shared utilities and helpers

## Quick Install

### React with Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install @mycomponents/react-tailwind
```

### React Headless (Unstyled)

```bash
npm install @mycomponents/react-unstyled
```

### React Native

```bash
npm install @mycomponents/react-native-unstyled
```

### Core Packages Only

If you want to build your own components using our core logic:

```bash
npm install @mycomponents/speech-to-text-core @mycomponents/text-to-speech-core @mycomponents/audio-recorder-core @mycomponents/utils
```

## Using the CLI

The easiest way to add components to your project is using our CLI tool:

```bash
npx @mycomponents/cli add speech-to-text --platform=react --style=tailwind
```

This will:
1. Install the necessary dependencies
2. Add the component to your project
3. Set up any required configuration

## Manual Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

Choose the packages that match your tech stack:

```bash
# For React with Tailwind
npm install @mycomponents/react-tailwind

# For React with Material-UI
npm install @mycomponents/react-mui

# For Vue with Tailwind
npm install @mycomponents/vue-tailwind

# For React Native
npm install @mycomponents/react-native-unstyled
```

### 2. Set Up Tailwind CSS (if using Tailwind variants)

Add our Tailwind configuration to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... your content paths
    './node_modules/@mycomponents/react-tailwind/**/*.js',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Component-specific theme extensions will be merged
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### 3. Import and Use Components

```tsx
import { SpeechToText, TextToSpeech } from '@mycomponents/react-tailwind';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SpeechToText onTranscript={(text) => console.log(text)} />
      <TextToSpeech text="Hello, world!" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## TypeScript Support

All packages include TypeScript definitions. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

```tsx
import { SpeechRecognitionState } from '@mycomponents/speech-to-text-core';
import { AudioData } from '@mycomponents/audio-recorder-core';

// Full type safety and autocompletion
```

## Browser Support

Our components support all modern browsers:

- Chrome/Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- iOS Safari 12+
- Chrome for Android

Some features like Speech Recognition may have limited support in certain browsers. Components will gracefully degrade or show appropriate fallbacks.
